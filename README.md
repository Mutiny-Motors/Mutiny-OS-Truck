# Mutiny-OS-Truck

## What
The goal of Mutiny is to design, manufacture and sell light duty electric vehicles that provide access to utility, mobility and fun for the least possible environmental and financial impact.

## Why
- Vehicles today are too large, too heavy, and too energy inefficient for the future weâ€™re quickly facing.
- Vehicles need to be able to do more with less in the near future.
- Current vehicles are expensive to obtain and operate simply because of the mass they need to motivate.

## The Mutiny OS Truck
**Functional Objectives:**
1. Kit less than $19,999 USD.
2. Kit is end-user assemblable using basic hand tools plus engine crane.
3. Manufacturable (Revision 1.0) at Andy's Factory without a major investment in tooling. (Major = >$10K USD).
4. We ship a driveable kit by end of Q2 2026.
5. Revision 1.0 will be an EV. Folowing revisions will consider hybrid/ICE variants.

**Subjective Goals:**
1. It's fun to drive
2. All major components are available readily int he US market from parts stores or junkyards in viable quantities and cost.
3. All primary parts are available on the Mutiny webstore.
4. All control software used in the vehicle is open and hackable.
5. Rushlessly cost-controlled. If it's not essential, it's not on here.
